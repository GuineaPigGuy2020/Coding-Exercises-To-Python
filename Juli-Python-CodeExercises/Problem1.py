	Coding Problem/Exercise # 1 - I don't know what is my name.
	
	Problem Description:
		I am Robert Waltson. I would like you to help me and my friends. 
		My Friends and I always for some reason always make extremely similar email addresses.
		THere is one time, Anna named her email-address abcd@gmail.com, while Kenneth named his email-address abcde@gmail.com.
		Whenever it is the end of semester we always use one phone to see our grades in our school's SIS,
		and we get confused which of the email addresses is our own!
		
		To solve this problem, this semester we would like to make a program that will accept our names and our email addresses,
		and display them in a format like this after it accepts all of our names and email addresses. 
		
		
		Names and Email Addresses
		
		Name #1 : Emailaddress #1
		Name #2 : Emailaddress #2
		Name #3 : Emailaddress #3
		Name #4 : Emailaddress #4
		Name #5 : Emailaddress #5
		
		The program only needs to accept 5 names and email addresses, since There is only 5 of us in our group.
		
		Why not just write them down in a piece of paper? We don't bring pieces of paper in school since we are too lazy to buy in the store.
		We also cannot ask pieces of paper from our classmates, since that is social interaction we can't afford.
		And, We just LOve PyTHon!!!!
